# Ada Constraint_Error Exception Example

This example demonstrates how to handle the `Constraint_Error` exception in Ada, specifically focusing on division by zero. Ada's strong typing and exception handling mechanisms make it relatively straightforward to manage such runtime errors. 

The `bug.ada` file contains the code which throws an exception, and the `bugSolution.ada` file provides a solution to handle it gracefully. 

## How to Run

1.  Save the code in files named `bug.ada` and `bugSolution.ada`.
2. Compile using an Ada compiler (like GNAT). 
3. Run the executable.

## Further Notes

This example highlights a common runtime error. Ada's approach to exception handling is clear and provides mechanisms for robust error management, which contrasts with languages that might allow such errors to crash the program without any clear indication.
